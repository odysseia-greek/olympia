# Odysseia <!-- omit in toc -->

Odysseia (Ὀδύσσεια) is one of the two famous poems by Homeros. It describes the journey of Odysseus and his crew to get home. Learning Greek is a bit like that - a odyssey. It is a hobby project that combines a few of my passions, both ancient Greek (history) and finding technical solutions for problems. As This is a hobby project first and foremost any mistakes are my own, either in translation or in interpation of text.

The goal is for people to learn or rehearse ancient Greek. Some of it is in Dutch but most of it is in English. There is also a dictionary that you can search through. Most of it is still very much a work in progress.

### Alexandros - Αλέξανδρος

Ου κλέπτω την νίκην - I will not steal my victory

What could I ever say in a few lines that would do justice to one of the most influential people of all time? Alexandros's energy and search for the end of the world was relentless, so too is his search for Greek words within odysseia.

### Dionysios - Διονύσιος ὁ Θρᾷξ

Γραμματική ἐστιν ἐμπειρία τῶν παρὰ ποιηταῖς τε καὶ συγγραφεῦσιν ὡς ἐπὶ τὸ πολὺ λεγομένων - Grammar is an experimental knowledge of the usages of language as generally current among poets and prose writers

Probably the first Greek Grammarian who wrote the "Τέχνη Γραμματική". Even though often called "the Thracian" he was most likely from Alexandria which was the hub for Greek learning for a long time.

### Herodotos - Ἡρόδοτος

Ἡροδότου Ἁλικαρνησσέος ἱστορίης ἀπόδεξις ἥδε - This is the display of the inquiry of Herodotos of Halikarnassos

Herodotos is often hailed as the father of history. I name he lives up to. His work (the histories) is a lively account of the histories of the Greeks and Persians and how they came into conflict. This API is responsible for passing along sentences you need to translate. They are then checked for accuracy.

### Sokrates - Σωκράτης

ἓν οἶδα ὅτι οὐδὲν οἶδα - I know one thing, that I know nothing

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Raffael_069.jpg" alt="Sokrates" width="200"/>

Sokrates (on the right) is a figure of mythical propertions. He could stare at the sky for days, weather cold in nothing but a simple cloak. Truly one of the greatest philosophers and a big influence on Plato which is why we know so much about him at all. A sokratic dialogue is a game of wits were the back and forth between Sokrates and whoever was unlucky (or lucky) to be part of the dialogue would end in frustration. Sokrates was known to question anyone until he had proven they truly knew nothing. As the API responsible for creating and asking questions he was the obvious choice.

### Homeros - Ὅμηρος

Αἶψα γὰρ ἐν κακότητι βροτοὶ καταγηράσκουσιν - Hardship can age a person overnight

### Hippokrates - Ἱπποκράτης

ὄμνυμι Ἀπόλλωνα ἰητρὸν καὶ Ἀσκληπιὸν καὶ Ὑγείαν καὶ Πανάκειαν καὶ θεοὺς πάντας τε καὶ πάσας, ἵστορας ποιεύμενος, ἐπιτελέα ποιήσειν κατὰ δύναμιν καὶ κρίσιν ἐμὴν ὅρκον τόνδε καὶ συγγραφὴν τήνδε - I swear by Apollo Healer, by Asclepius, by Hygieia, by Panacea, and by all the gods and goddesses, making them my witnesses, that I will carry out, according to my ability and judgment, this oath and this indenture.
